This code trains chaotic recurrent neural networks (RNNs)for arbitrary tasks with *sparse*, *delayed* rewards using a node-perturbation method (as in Fiete & Seung, Phys Rev Lett 2006), as described in  
["Training recurrent neural networks with sparse, delayed rewards for flexible decision tasks"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08973)

NOTE: **This code is obsolete and is only kept for reference purposes.** If you want to implement node-perturbation for chaotic RNNs, consult [this repository](https://github.com/ThomasMiconi/BiologicallyPlausibleLearningRNN/tree/master/dnms) instead for much better performance.
